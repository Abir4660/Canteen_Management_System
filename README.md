This app uses the following main database tables:

- `USERS` – stores login credentials and roles  
- `MENU` – holds available items and prices  
- `ORDERS` – customer orders  
- `ORDER_ITEMS` – links orders and menu items  
- `PAYMENTS` – records transactions

## ⚙️ Backend Logic (PL/SQL)

### Function: `GET_ORDER_TOTAL(p_order_id NUMBER)`
Calculates total order amount by summing menu item prices.

### Trigger: `TRG_VALIDATE_PAYMENT`

- Updates order status automatically to `SERVED`
